        <p> FOGLOG is a computing power marketplace.</p>
        <p>We make it easier for hardware owners to rent out their resources and provide the world with affordable computing power.</p>

         <p>Now anyone can share their computation with others and make some extra money</p>

        <p>FOGLOG enables users and applications (requestors) to rent out cycles of other usersâ€™ (providers) machines. Any user ranging from a single PC owner to a large data center can share resources and get paid by requestors.</p>
